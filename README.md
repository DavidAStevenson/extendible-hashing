# extendible-hashing
An old project from my university days refreshed to modern C++, with automated testing added

- Catch2 is used testing.

Basic compiliation and running notes:
```
make [catch2test] [gtest]
```
Running catch2 tests:
```
./catch2test
```
Running googletest tests:
```
./gtest
```
Cleaning up
```
make clean
```

TODO
- Complete port of the bit operations library, with tests
- Add a trimmed down Vagrantfile with just the necessary items to build and run
- More c++11,14 study
- More reading of Google's C++ style guide
- Figure out the problem with my namespace declarations
