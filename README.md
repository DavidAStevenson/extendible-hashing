# extendible-hashing
An old project from my university days refreshed to modern C++, with automated testing added

- Catch2 is used testing.

Basic compiliation and running notes:
```
make tester
```
Running tests:
```
./tester
```
Cleaning up
```
make clean
```


TODO
- Complete port of the bit operations library, with tests
- Do some testing with googletest framework as well, for comparision
- Add a trimmed down Vagrantfile with just the necessary items to build and run
- More c++11,14 study
- More reading of Google's C++ style guide
- Figure out the problem with my namespace declarations
